                <p>My name is <b>Jack.</b> I was born and raised somwhere in Ikea. So, before you ask, yes, I do speak Ikean, but don't tell anybody. I went to <i>Harvard Business School</i> to study...business. I am a busness shark!</p>
                <p>Go to My Day section if you want to learn more about me, or just <i><a href="day.html" class="click">click here.</a></i> And if you don't, would you mind still click, please? You are my first visitor.</p>
